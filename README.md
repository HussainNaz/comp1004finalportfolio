this is my game project and code for my final portfolio submission (04/04/2025)

# block jump
this game is a simple parkour jumping game. the player (you) spawn as a square and have to jump over the obstacles in your path, in this case being blue rectangles.
in this game, speed, size of blocks and timing is different on every run, making sure not 1 run is the same and offering a different experience of the game each time.
this is an endless game that will go on for as long as you can jump.

# instructions
though there is an instructions page when you load up the game i will give it here aswell just to a little more in depth.
the only button you need to worry about is the SPACEBAR. you have to time your jumps well so that you can hop over
the obstacles but not every jump will be the same, sometimes u may have to jump later or earlier depending on size and width.

# features
in this game as ive mentioned there is randomizers for every part of the gameplay. the blocks in your way will always have a different width and height,
the speed of the game will also be random for every run. 
there is a points tally in the top left that will count and display everytime you jump over a block.
next is a timer, this shows how long you have been in your run for. all of the info of your run will be saved in a JSON file after you die which you then can
look at.
lastly is the menu page, here there are 3 options 1- play game/ 2- instructions/ 3-quit game

enjoy the game :)
